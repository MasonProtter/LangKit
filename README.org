* REPLMaker
The idea here is to make a tool for people making (domain specific) languages in julia. 
A user of this package will be required to give a function that parses code from whatever langauge the user has 
implemented and turns it into julia code which is then executed by julia. LangKit will then create a repl mode where end users 
just type code from the implemented language and have it be parsed into julia code automatically.
